## My website in 2024

Decided I wanted to make my personal website more personal. These kind of vibe check blogs from [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2024/03/vibe-check-31/) and weeknotes from [Anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2024/weeknotes-12/) always struck me as fun ways to document everyday life.

## Ten years ago

I came across a bunch of old photos from ten years ago. I was more active with photography and videography during this time. These are some of the photos I resonated with most.
