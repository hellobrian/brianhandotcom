I'm trying a slightly different setup with my [Fuji X100V](https://brianhan.com/tags/fuji%20x100v/). Instead of relying on film simulation bracketing, I'm manually switching between film recipes in my custom profiles. I'm still using [Reggie's Portra](https://reggiebphotography.com/blog/the-most-versatile-fujifilm-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe-reggies-portra), and I've also added [Reggie's HP5 B&W](https://reggiebphotography.com/blog/the-most-versatile-fujifilm-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe-reggies-hp5) film recipe in the rotation. I think his black-and-white recipe looks noticeably better than using Acros stock.

For me, the tough part with wanting to use both of these film recipes is taking the time to switch between them. It's definitely not as convenient as using film sim bracketing.

## Cool dudes, and their rides

I was surprised to get photos of dudes riding their bikes that weren't terrible! When I wanted to grab some photos of these guys,I realized I should try to learn how to range focus. I'm using single point auto focus, and it's just a little too slow for these quick up-close moments.
