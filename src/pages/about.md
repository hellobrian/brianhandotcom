I'm a Senior UX Developer based in Austin, TX specializing in
creating user-friendly interfaces and improving user experiences using
HTML, CSS, and React. My focus is on collaborating closely with designers, engineers and product managers to deliver solutions that are scalable, responsive, and accessible.

At **[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/hire)**, I worked on multiple platforms for employers: Indeed Hire, [Smart Sourcing](https://www.indeed.com/employers/smart-sourcing), and [Premium Job Sourcing](https://www.indeed.com/hire/cs/sponsored-jobs) - all of which aimed to help employers hire people more easily and efficiently. I implemented complex designs and layouts while helping teams to deliver more accessible experiences using semantic HTML and tools like aXe.

At **[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/)**, I helped start [Carbon Design Systems](https://carbondesignsystem.com/), IBM's open source design system that leverages IBM Design Language. This helped to standardize code and interfaces on large scale basis at IBM - delievering a more consistent experience to users and developers.

Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, building mechanical keyboards, and travelling wherever I can. I'm currently shooting with a [Fuji X100V](/tags/Fuji%20X100V), and doing most of my typing with a [Tiger 80 Lite](/blog/2024/keebs-tiger80lite-olivia/) TKL keyboard.
