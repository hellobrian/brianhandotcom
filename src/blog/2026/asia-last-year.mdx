Last summer, I took a trip to Asia with my Dad. We went from Seoul staying in the Jongno area, Singapore, Busan in the Haeundae area, and then I flew to Fukuoka on my own, and then took a train to Tokyo staying in Shibuya near Harajuku. Went on a lot more walks, and tried to keep my camera out as much as possible. Here are some photos from the trip.

## Tokyo

Didn't end up taking my camera with me around here - I was mainly focused on shopping 🛍️ and eating 🍜.
